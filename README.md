# CS170 Project 1 - The Eight Puzzle

This project implements three search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle using C++.
These three algorithms are Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* Search with Misplaced Tile Heuristic, A* Search with Manhattan Distance Heuristic. 

The goal of this project is to compare the efficiency of these algorithms based on solution depth (number of moves to reach the goal state), nodes expanded (number of nodes explored), and max queue size (memory usage during search).
